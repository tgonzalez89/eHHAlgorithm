[-D NO_BENCH] don't ouput the timing information benchmarking how much the program took to run.
[-D NETWORK_SIZE=<number>] to indicate amount of neurons in the network (default is 1)
[-D SIMULATION_STEPS=<number>] to indicate amount of simulation steps (default is 20)
[-fopenmp] to run with multiple cores (timing measurements will not be accurate)
